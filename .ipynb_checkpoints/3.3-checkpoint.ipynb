    "\n",
    "Commander Lambda has asked for your help to refine the automatic quantum antimatter fuel injection system for her LAMBCHOP doomsday device. It's a great chance for you to get a closer look at the LAMBCHOP - and maybe sneak in a bit of sabotage while you're at it - so you took the job gladly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum antimatter fuel comes in small pellets, which is convenient since the many moving parts of the LAMBCHOP each need to be fed fuel one pellet at a time. However, minions dump pellets in bulk into the fuel intake. You need to figure out the most efficient way to sort and shift the pellets down to a single pellet at a time. \n",
    "\n",
    "The fuel control mechanisms have three operations: \n",
    "\n",
    "1) Add one fuel pellet\n",
    "2) Remove one fuel pellet\n",
    "3) Divide the entire group of fuel pellets by 2 (due to the destructive energy released when a quantum antimatter pellet is cut in half, the safety controls will only allow this to happen if there is an even number of pellets)\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function called solution(n) which takes a positive integer as a string and returns the minimum number of operations needed to transform the number of pellets to 1. The fuel intake control panel can only display a number up to 309 digits long, so there won't ever be more pellets than you can express in that many digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "solution(4) returns 2: 4 -> 2 -> 1\n",
    "solution(15) returns 5: 15 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1\n",

    "\n",
    "This problem can be solved in several ways, and I decided to analyze a few of \n",
    "them. The simpler way is by brute force: at each step, test each of the three \n",
    "operations (add 1, subtract 1, or divide by 2) and choose the one that let you \n",
    "closer to the solution (n==1). This approach is implemented in the function \n",
    "*solutionBrute(n)* and is a modified version of \\cite{1}.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this problem exhibits overlapping subproblems, leading to computing \n",
    "several times the same thing. With that in mind, we can use a Dynamic \n",
    "Programing approach, saving the intermediate results to avoid re-computing \n",
    "them. This approach is implemented in the function *solutionDP(n)* and is \n",
    "entirely based on \\cite{1}.\n",
    "\n",
    "A third possible approach is to decide between add or subtract one by checking \n",
    "which option maximizes the number of LSB zeros (and thus maximizes the number \n",
    "of divisions by 2), instead of testing both. Furthermore, with this approach we \n",
    "use much less memory, because we don't need to store intermediary results. This \n",
    "approach was implemented recursively in the function *solutionRecursive(n)*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Though this approach already has a good performance, it can be easily improved \n",
    "by implementing it inside a while loop (like was done in \\cite{2}), instead of \n",
    "recursively, in consequence doing fewer functions calls. To every approach is \n",
    "possible to do some micro-optimizations, like checking if a number is odd/even\n",
    "by checking the LSB (instead of n%2==0) or diving by two simply doing an \n",
